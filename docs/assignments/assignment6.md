# Assignment 6 (Alpha) - User Testing & Analysis

## Task List

| **Task Title** | **Task Instructions** | **Task Rationale** |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
|**Authenticating & Sessioning**|Create an account on Rely, then attempt to log out and log in.|This is a relatively simple warmup task that covers the authenticating and sessioning concepts. While this task is generic and basic, it acts as a good way for the user to get comfortable with completing a task while under observation. This task also allows me to see if authenticating and sessioning are intuitive and easy to do.|
|**Posting**|Take a look at the posts on Rely to get a general sense of the content, then create a post of your own.|This is a relatively straightforward task that covers the posting concept. I want to see if creating your own content on Rely is intuitive and easy to do for a new user.|
|**Reacting**|Take a look at the other posts on Rely and like or dislike to any post(s) that catch your interest. Now choose a post and go through it's comments, also liking or disliking any of the post's comment(s) that catch your interest.|This task covers the reacting concept. I want to see if it is easy for users to interact with posts and navigate the post feed and the comments of a post (liking, disliking, viewing comments, collapsing/showing sub-comments, etc)|
|**Commenting**|Reply to post that you were looking at in the previous task, either agreeing or disagreeing with it in your reply. Then, reply to a comment of your chosing (that isn't your own comment), either agreeing or disagreeing with it in your reply.|This task covers the commenting concept. I want to see how easy it is for users to reply to posts and comments.|
|**Following**|Follow any user(s) that you want on Rely. You can go back to the home feed as well as any previous posts or comments to find users to follow.|This task covers the following concept. I want to see how easy it is for users to follow other users. As the user goes back to the home feed or any previous posts/comments, I can also see if they are able to navigate it just as smoothly or more smoothly than the first time they navigated through the website.|
|**Following pt. 2**|Go to the home page. Then, switch between the "All" and "Following" post feeds. If your "Following" post feed still has no posts, try following some more users and seeing what happens.| This task covers the rest of the following concept. I want to see how easy it is for users to navigate between the different post feeds.|
|**Profiles**|Go to your own profile and look at the information about you to confirm that it is to your expectations. Then, go through your follower list and following list on your profile page to see if it is to your expectations.|This task covers the basics of the profiles concept. I want to see how easy it is for users to navigate their own profile and see their own information. I also want to see how easy it is for users to navigate their follower and following lists.|
|**Profiles pt. 2**|Now click through other users' profiles to see their information. You can access other profiles through follower/following lists, as well as clicking on their username on posts or comments.|This task covers the rest of profiles concept. I want to see how easy it is for users to navigate other users' profiles and see their information.|

Note that while there is no specific task that covers the Scoring concept, the tasks that the users go through will (hopefully) give them a basic intuition on how the Rely-ability scoring system works. After a user completes th Posting task and Commenting task, I will react and reply to their posts and concepts to influence their user Rely-ability score. This way, by the time they start doing the Profiles task and view their own profile, they can see their Rely-ability score and understand how it is calculated. I will, of course, be asking them to explain their thoughts and observations throughout the user testing process to see if they understand the Rely-ability scoring system.
