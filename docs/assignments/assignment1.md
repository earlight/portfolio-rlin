# Assignment 1 - Social Media Needfinding

## Pre-Interview Plans

### Hunch/Theme

I wanted to explore ways to more effectively combat misinformation and misleading AI generated content on social media, allowing users to easily identify misleading or AI generated content at a glance, even when the content is designed to look legitimate. 

### Who to Interview

I am aware of how prominent misinformation is on social media platforms, as well as how dangerously easy it is to generate AI content that looks legitimate and human-made. However, there are many people using social media that may be much more suspectible to misinformation or not be as familiar with the realism that cutting-edge AI generated content can achieve.

I would want to interview people who are not as aware of the prevalance and dangers of misinformation, as well as people who are more likely to be fooled by AI generated content. This could include older generations, people who are not as tech-savvy, or people who are less familiar with generative AI. By interviewing people who are more likely to be fooled by misinformaiton and AI generated content, I can better identiy potential solutions of making it easier to spot fakse and misleading content on social media.

I would also prefer to interview poeple of varying ages and levels of tech-savviness to get a more diverse perspective on how people handle misinformation and AI generated content on social media.

### Conversation Starters Brainstorm

I wouldn't want to dive straight into the topic of misinformation and fake AI generated content, since people would tend to believe that they themselves are capable of spotting fake content (I could also be overestimating my ability to identify fake content). Instead, I would want to start by learning about their general use of social media and getting to know how tech-savvy in order to better approach the main topic.

- How do you spend your time when you are online?
- How do you stay connected with friends and family?
- Can you describe how and why you use social media?
- Walk me though your typical day on the internet or using social media.
- How do you stay up to date with current events and whats going on in the world?

From these questions, I can get a good general understanding of someone's tech-savviness and social media usage habits. If I identify any way they use social media different from me, I can ask them to elaborate more on that to get a better understanding of other perspectives or follow up with a variation of some of the following questions that more closely relate to their previous answers.

- What do you think misinformation looks like on social media? Have you ever seen any?
- What are some obvious signs that content on social media is fake or misleading?
- How do you think the social media apps you use prevent the spread of misinformation?
