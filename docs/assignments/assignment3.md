# Assignment 3 - Convergent Design

## Pitch

**Rely** is revolutionary social media platform that emphasizes reliability and misinformation prevention, allowing anyone to easily identify misinformation or fake content even when it is designed to look legitamite. This allows people who not tech-savvy enough to identify signs of misinformation to be able to easily spot when a piece of content is unreliable or fake. 

Every post and comment on Rely has a reliability score that allows users to easily identify if a piece of content is fake or not. Rely takes into account the reactions and comments from other users, the historial reliability of the user who posted the content, third-party fact-checking, and other factors in give a holistic and accurate reliability score for each post and comment.

Every user on Rely has a reliability rating that is displayed on their profile, posts, and comments, allowing other users to easy spot historically untrustworthy sources. A user's reliability rating is calculated based on the reliability of their posts and comments, the reliability of users who interact with their content, and other factors.

Rely's recommendation algorithm and personalized feeds also prioritize the reliability of content, ensure that misinformation and fake content is distributed less on the platform to prevent them from going viral, while also promoting and incentivizing the consistent creation of reliable content. Rely will foster a safe and trustworthy environment for users to share and consume content while also having the same social media experience they are used to, exploring entertaining content and connecting with others.
