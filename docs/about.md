Yo what's good everybody, my name is **Richard Lin**, and this is the greatest About Me page of all time.

Let's start at the beginning. It's a late Thursday afternoon on May 22nd, 2003. The sun was setting on the Town of North Hempsted in New York. In the North Shore University Hospital, a beautiful baby boy was born. He weighed 8 pounds, slightly above average. The boy will eventually find that he is above average in every thing he does.

...

Fast forward 21 years, and here I am, a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studying Computer Science. I'm a software developer, a designer, a writer, a musician, a photographer, a filmmaker, a philosopher, a mathematician, a physicist, a chemist, a biologist, a psychologist, a sociologist, a historian, a linguist, a geographer, a political scientist, an economist, a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a student, a friend, a son, a brother, a cousin, a nephew, a grandson, a boyfriend, a lover, a human being.
